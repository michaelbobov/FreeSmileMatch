# FreeSmileMatch
SmileMatch is a specialized service designed to connect dental hygiene and other medical students with patients in need of affordable or free dental care. It addresses a critical gap in the market by making it easier for students to find patients to meet their clinical requirements while providing a valuable medical service to underserved communities.

The platform operates through a user-friendly interface where students can create profiles detailing their availability, location, and the types of procedures they can perform. Patients, who may lack dental insurance or the financial means to afford regular dental care, can browse available students and book appointments for free or low-cost cleanings and other dental services.
